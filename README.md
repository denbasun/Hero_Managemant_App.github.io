This is test project with hero admin panel built with React and Redux Toolkit, designed to manage a list of heroes from a computer game. The application offers an intuitive interface with the following features:

Create Heroes: Add new heroes to the list, including setting descriptions and magic elements. Data is saved to and retrieved from a local JSON file.

Edit and Delete Heroes: Update hero details or remove heroes from the list, with changes persisted to the JSON file.

Magic Element Assignment: Assign magic elements to heroes, which can be used for filtering.

Filtering: Filter the hero list based on the assigned magic elements to find specific types of heroes.

Smooth Transitions: Utilizes React Transition Group and CSS Transition to provide smooth animations and transitions for a more engaging user experience.

Local Data Storage: Uses a local JSON file to store and manage hero data, with updates made upon form submission.
